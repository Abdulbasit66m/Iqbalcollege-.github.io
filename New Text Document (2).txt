X-rays are a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves. X-ray imaging creates
 pictures of the inside of your body. The images show the parts of your body in different 
shades of black and white. This is because different tissues absorb different amounts of radiation.
 Calcium in bones absorbs x-rays the most, so bones look white.
